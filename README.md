- 👋 Hi, I’m @dimsunlight
- 👀 I’m interested in computational modeling soft matter physics -- at the moment, effects on living systems from the shapes of their environments.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to write curved space simulation code in Python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff relating to the above. How can we combine knowledge of curvature with your physical problem to generate robust, physically relevant solutions?
- 📫 How to reach me: my e-mail is toler.webb@emory.edu.
