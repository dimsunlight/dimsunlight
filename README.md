- 👋 Hi, I’m @dimsunlight
- 👀 I like working with efficient computational modeling in curved space using discrete differential geometry. 
- 🌱 I'm learning more about programming broadly and exploring how to incorporate AI into highly efficient workflows.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff relating to the above. How can we combine knowledge of curvature with your physical problem to generate robust, physically relevant solutions?
- 📫 How to reach me: my e-mail is toler.webb@emory.edu.
